# Loteria Memory Edition

## Loteria Game History
The origin of lotería can be traced far back in history. The game originated in Italy in the 15th century and was brought to New Spain (modern Mexico) in 1769. In the beginning, lotería was a hobby of the upper classes, but eventually it became a tradition at Mexican fairs.

## Motivation
This game was made for my grandma, it is her favorite game, and after her being diagnosed with cancer I wanted to be able to create a new type of game for her to play with the same classic feel.
