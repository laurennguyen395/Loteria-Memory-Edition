# Loteria Memory Game

## Loteria Game History
The origin of lotería can be traced far back in history. The game originated in Italy in the 15th century and was brought to New Spain (modern Mexico) in 1769. In the beginning, lotería was a hobby of the upper classes, but eventually it became a tradition at Mexican fairs.

## Motivation
This game was made for my grandma, it is her favorite game, and after her being diagnosed with cancer I wanted to be able to create a new type of game for her to play with the same classic feel.

## User Stories/game logic

* User will arrive on landing page, where they will read some simple instructions and click the start button.

* Once the start button has been clicked, 18 cards will appear with an array of different images in a random order.

* The player must rememeber where all the images are in the table and how many there were.

* After 15 seconds the computer will choose a card for the player to have to find.

* The player must flip over all cards of the specific image asked for and hit "Done". They have 30 seconds.

* Once they hit done, all the cards will reveal their images and the player will be able to see if they missed any.

## Future Development
